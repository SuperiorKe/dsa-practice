# Daily Coding Practice

I am Kenn, a self-taught software engineer preparing for my first Software Engineering role. 
This repo tracks my daily problem-solving practice as I strengthen my fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Goal
Solve at least 1 Codewars/LeetCode problem daily and document my learning process.

## Progress
- **Total Problems Solved:** 47
- **Current Streak:** 12 days
- **Focus Areas:** Arrays, Hash Maps, String Manipulation, Greedy Algorithms

## What I am Learning
- How to break down ambiguous problems into clear steps
- Writing clean, Pythonic code with proper edge case handling
- Recognising common patterns (two-pointer, sliding window, etc.)
- Explaining my thought process clearly (crucial for interviews)

## Structure
Problems are organised by category and include:
- Problem description and link
- My approach and reasoning
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Key concepts and real-world applications
