# Daily Coding Practice

I am Kenn Macharia, a self-taught software engineer preparing for my first Software Engineering role. 
This repo tracks my daily problem-solving practice as I strengthen my fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 🎯 Goal
Solve at least 1 Codewars/LeetCode problem daily and document my learning process.

## 📊 Progress
- **Total Problems Solved:** 1
- **Current Streak:** 1 day
- **Focus Areas:** Arrays, Hash Maps, Strings, Greedy Algorithms

## 🧠 What I'm Learning
- Breaking down ambiguous problems into clear, actionable steps
- Writing clean, Pythonic code with proper edge case handling
- Recognising common algorithm patterns (two-pointer, sliding window, greedy, etc.)
- Explaining my thought process clearly (crucial for technical interviews)

## 📂 Structure
Problems are organised by category. Each solution includes:
- Problem description and link
- My approach and reasoning
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Key concepts and real-world applications
- Test cases
